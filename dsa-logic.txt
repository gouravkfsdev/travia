**DSA-Based Features Implemented in Tourism Admin Panel ("MY Plan")**

---

### 1. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

**DSA Concept:** Set / Map

* Roles: Admin / Editor / Viewer
* Use Maps to define permissions

---

### 2. Nested Comments / Review System

**DSA Concept:** Tree + Recursion

* `comments` collection with `parentId`
* Recursive rendering of threaded replies

---

### 3. Visit Analytics

**DSA Concept:** Prefix Sum / HashMap Frequency

* Track daily visits in `visits` collection
* Analyze: Last 7 days, Monthly visits, Top visitor cities, Top places

---

### 4. Nearby Places (Within 50km)

**DSA Concept:** Geo / Graph / Greedy

* MongoDB GeoSpatial Queries using `location.coordinates`
* `$near` query to find places within 50km

---

### 5. Similar Places (Tag Matching)

**DSA Concept:** Graph (Tag relationship)

* Find places with overlapping tags and same city/state
* Recommend similar places using shared tags

---

### 6. Trending / Top Rated Places

**DSA Concept:** Custom Sorting / Comparator

* Use logic: `views * rating`
* Sort descending to get trending content

---

### 7. Auto Suggest (Search Bar)

**DSA Concept:** Prefix Search / Trie

* When user types "Ta" → Suggest "Taj Mahal"
* MongoDB `$regex` for real-time prefix match

---

### 8. Tag-Based Filtering

**DSA Concept:** Hashing / Sets

* Filter places based on tags (e.g., historic, food, family)
* Efficient querying using `$in` operator on tags array

---

### 9. You May Also Like

**DSA Concept:** Graph / Tag Recommendation

* Show related places (tags match, same location)
* Avoid showing the same place (exclude current `_id`)

---

### 10. Visit History Per User / Location / City

**DSA Concept:** Frequency Table / Aggregation

* Group `visits` by `userId`, `city`, `placeId`
* Summarize top visited data weekly/monthly

---

### 11. Infinite Scroll / Pagination

**DSA Concept:** Sliding Window / Two Pointers

* Load more places/comments as user scrolls
* Pagination using skip/limit

---

### 12. Search Logging for Trends

**DSA Concept:** Map / Count frequency

* Store every search term in `search_logs`
* Suggest popular queries

---

These features ensure the system is smart, efficient, scalable, and ready for analytics, recommendations, and user engagement features — all powered using DSA logic.
